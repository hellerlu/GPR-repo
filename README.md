# Introduction
This contains my master thesis related code for a numerical model in GPR (Ground Penetrating Radar) in railway ballast applications.

It consists of several algorithms such as: 
- Random Sequential Adsorption 2D and 3D
- Compaction Algortithm 2D and 3D
- Finite Difference-Time-Domain Method (FDTD) using gprMax module

Most of the running applications are run on the Euler cluster.
